### scripts.py

The **_scripts.py_**'s jupyter notebook contains all of the exercises: both the ones which I've been able to do that the ones I've not been able to complete (in this last case there is a line where #TODO is written). In both cases the code is preceed by the section of Hackerrank (*Introductions*, *Data Types* and so on) and by the title of the specific exercise (*Say "Hello, World!" With Python*, *List Comprehensions* and so on)   

### stamps/

the **_stamps_/** folder contains all the screenshots that assess the successful exercises I made
